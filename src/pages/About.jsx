      <p>
          At my college, Borough of Manhattan Community College, in my
          first semester, I took a Java introductory class. As I
          started learning, I’ll admit, it was boring and confusing
          at first, but as time went on, I found myself investing
          more and more time into my Java projects until I become somewhat “decent”.

          And as I consider myself a sports lover, as I had been doing track and
          field, cricket and soccer for my previous schools, programming gave me
          the same feeling of accomplishment from my sporting days. And so I went
          on to teach myself web development as it was a huge trend in 2016, and
          because I enjoy the web the mostly.
          Sorry Java, your second behind Javascript.

      <h3>How I got into Programming</h3>
      <p>I started learning web development from a Udemy course and then
         I went on to other resources. Tutorials, conferences and podcasts
         on Youtube, reading helpful sites like StackOverflow, CSSTricks,
         Mozilla Developer Network and Scotch.io propelled me forward as I
         gradually was been to create what I could imagine in my head. I study
         HTML, CSS and Javascript on my over three-hour commute to college.
         I believe that the way I learnt web development has prepared me
         to tackle difficult challenges head on.
