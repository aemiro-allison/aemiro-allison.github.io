      <p>I started learning web development from a Udemy course and then
         I went on to other resources. Tutorials, conferences and podcasts
         on Youtube, reading helpful sites like StackOverflow, CSSTricks,
         Mozilla Developer Network and Scotch.io propelled me forward as I
         gradually was been to create what I could imagine in my head. I study
         HTML, CSS and Javascript on my over three-hour commute to college.
         I believe that the way I learnt web development has prepared me
         to tackle difficult challenges head on.
