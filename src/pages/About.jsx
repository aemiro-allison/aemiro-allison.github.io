          At my college, Borough of Manhattan Community College, in my
          first semester, I took a Java introductory class. As I
          started learning, I’ll admit, it was boring and confusing
          at first, but as time went on, I found myself investing
          more and more time into my Java projects until I become somewhat “decent”.

          As I consider myself a sports lover, as I had been doing track and
          field, cricket and soccer at my previous schools, programming gave me
          the same feeling of accomplishment from my sporting days. Hence, I began
          my journey into web development as it was a huge trend in 2016, and
          mostly because I enjoy the web more than Java. Sorry Java, your
          second behind Javascript.

      <h3>How I got into Web Development</h3>
      <p>I started learning web development from a Udemy course and then
         I went on to other resources. Tutorials, conferences and podcasts
         on Youtube, as well as reading helpful sites like StackOverflow, CSSTricks,
         Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) and Scotch.io, propelled me forward as I
         was gradually able to create what I could imagine. I studied
         HTML, CSS and Javascript on my more than three-hour commute to college.
         I believe that the way I began web development has blostered my preparation
         for tackling difficult challenges head on.

      <h3>What I&#39;m Currently Doing</h3>
      <p>
        As of October 17, 2017, I completed a web development immersive program at General Assembly that prepares students
        to enter into the real world of web development. Their curriculum included:
        <ul>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>Javascript/ JQuery / React</li>
          <li>Node / Express</li>
          <li>PostgreSQL</li>
          <li>Ruby / Ruby on Rails</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
