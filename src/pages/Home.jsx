        <p> I am a recent graduate living in Queens,
            New York. As I am 19, I want to take advantage of my youth and go very
            far in the business world which is why I like to watch entrepreneurial
            shows on MSBNC like Shark Tank and the Profit. I had always liked
            the idea of building things since I was young. I wanted to take what
            was in my mind and convert it into reality and I found could do just
            that with programming.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>How I got into Programming</h3>
        <p> At my college, Borough of Manhattan Community College, in my
            first semester, I took a Java introductory class. As I
            started learning, I’ll admit, it was boring and confusing
            at first, but as time went on, I found myself investing
            more and more time into my Java projects until I become somewhat “decent”.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p> And as I consider myself a sports lover, as I had been doing track and
            field, cricket and soccer for my previous schools, programming gave me
            the same feeling of accomplishment from my sporting days. And so I went
            on to teach myself web development as it was a huge trend in 2016, and
            because I enjoy the web the mostly.
            Sorry Java, your second behind Javascript.
